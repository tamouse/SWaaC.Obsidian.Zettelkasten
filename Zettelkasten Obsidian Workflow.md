## Simple Set up

> Goal: turn inputs into outputs

### Flow
1. Capture
2. Process
3. Connect
4. Produce
5. Feedback

#### Capture
- Two types:
	- Fleeting notes
	- Literature
		- notes taken while studying or consuming literature (not limited to printed books, puhlease)

- **Write down everything that is interesting to me**
	- practice observing, noticing, and capturing
	- you cannot judge an idea statically - it's value changes over time


> [!NOTE] Why write stuff down?
> The point of ZK is to build and connect ideas *over time*, to produce new output



#### Process
- Structure
	- directories are far less useful than they seem
	- utilize search and tags
	- make my notes atomic
	- make them searchable

3 "categories":
1. questions
2. ideas
3. supplemental tools

Questions get tagged with "# question"
Ideas are tagged by the type of thing they are or will lead to, e.g. blog post, newsletter, document
Supplementary tools: this to study further, anecdotes, other links

Specific tags for inputs:
- build
- check
- toread or towatch (these would include note taking while doing that)

Put useful keywords in the title and in the body, not as tags, just bare words, to make notes with those topics easier to find.


> [!NOTE] ZK is training us
> Zettelkasten is training us to notice, capture, process, and **prepare** us for creating output


> [!success] Keywords â‡’ Topics
